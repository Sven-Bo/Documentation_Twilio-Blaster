# Settings overview

The settings menu in Twilio Blaster allows you to customize formatting, notifications, and advanced options.  The message delay settings are explained here: [how-to-set-custom-delays-between-messages.md](how-to-set-custom-delays-between-messages.md "mention")

### 1. Formatting

* When copying and pasting values into Twilio Blaster, the **original formatting** is kept to ensure a tidy structure.
* If you prefer, you can disable this option.
* When entering phone numbers in the **Receiver** column, a **plus sign (+) is automatically added** to format numbers correctly. You can disable this if needed.\
