# How to set custom delays between messages

You can customize the delay between messages in the **Settings**.

### 1. Access the Settings

* Click on **Settings** in the main menu.
* Navigate to the **General** tab.

### 2. Set Default Delay

* The **Default Delay Between Messages** is the time gap (in seconds) between each message.
* You can set it anywhere between **0 seconds (instant sending)** and **86,400 seconds (24 hours)**.
* By default, this is set to **0 seconds**.

### 3. Enable Random Delay (Optional)

* Turn **Random Delay Between Messages** **ON** if you want an additional random delay.
* Set a **Min Delay** and **Max Delay** (in seconds).
* This adds a **random extra delay** on top of the default delay.

#### Example

If your **Default Delay** is set to **5 seconds** and your **Random Delay** range is **2 to 4 seconds**, each message will be sent after **5 seconds + a random extra delay (between 2 and 4 seconds)**.

### 4. Save Your Settings

* Click **Save Settings** to apply the changes.
