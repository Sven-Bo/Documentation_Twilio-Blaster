# How to add extra devices to your license

Your license includes **up to three computers**. If you need more, you can add extra device slots. Each slot unlocks one more computer.

### How it works

* Extra devices use their own subscription.
* You can start them whenever you need.
* Each one has its own renewal date.
* You can cancel them anytime.
* Your main subscription must stay active.

### Example

Your main subscription renews on the 28th.\
You add one extra device on the 5th.

**What happens**

* Main subscription renews on the 28th as usual.
* Extra device renews on the 5th every month.
* Both run independently.
* You can cancel the extra device whenever you like.
